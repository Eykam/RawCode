<h3> Pre-recorded Videos from CMSC 424 Fall 2020 </h3>
We are making all the pre-recorded videos from Fall 2020 available here -- you can expect about 90% overlap in the topics covered this semester.
<br>
The website for Fall 2021 course is here: <a href=https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1308069>CMSC 424, Fall 2021</a>.
<br>
<br>
The videos are split across six topics. NoSQL, and in particular document stores and other types of NoSQL stores, were not covered in depth in Fall 2020.
<ul>
<li> <a href=introduction.html>Introduction:</a> These videos cover motivation for studying databases; notions of data models and data independence/abstraction; 
different types of database architectures that are prevalent today; and a brief discussion of the most popular databases in the industry.
<li> <a href=relational_sql.html>Relational Model and SQL -- also, brief discussion of Web Application Development:</a> Here we go deeper into the relational model and
cover SQL, as well as relational algebra and formal semantics underlying SQL. We also go through how database-backed Web Applications are architected, and discuss
Python Django framework in some detail (Python Django is not covered in the Fall 2021 edition).
<li> <a href=er_normalization.html>Database Design: E/R Models and Normalization:</a> These videos cover entity-relationship model and normalization (for relational
        model). 
<li> <a href=implementation.html>Implementation Issues: Storage, Indexing, Query Processing, Query Optimization:</a> Implementation aspects covered include storage
devices, indexes for faster retrieval of data, query processing algorithms, and query optimization. In Fall 2021, we cover some of the topics in less depth to make room
for NoSQL discussion.
<li> <a href=transactions.html>Transactions:</a> How transactions (i.e., updates) are handled in database systems, including both the concepts and guarantees as well as
implementation.
<li> <a href=rest.html>Parallel Databases, MapReduce, Miscellaneous Topics (OLAP, Distributed Transactions, Information Retrieval, Object-oriented and
        Object-relational):</a> Some of these topics are covered in "NoSQL" portion in Fall 2021, including MapReduce/Spark. Distributed transactions will likely be covered as part of "Transactions" module in Fall 2021.
</ul>
